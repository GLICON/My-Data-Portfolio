### Project Overview

This data analysis aims to provide answers to some questions by evaluating Amazon smartwatches and smartphones actual prices, discounted prices, percentage discounts and ratings.


### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "amazon.csv" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools

- Excel (Data cleaning)
- SQL Server (Data Analysis)
- Excel (Data visualization)

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Filtering out of necessary data
3. Handling missing values
4. Data formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring Amazon smartwristwatches and smartphones to answer key questions, such as:

1.Are Amazon discounts more competitive in the smartwatches or smartphones category?

2.Do smartwatches discounts exhibit more variability than smartphones discounts? Are the distributions of the discounts symmetric or skewed?

3.How does the smartwatches discount percentages vary with the ratings?

4.Is there a correlation (linear relationship) between the discount percentage on smartwatches/smartphones and the actual prices/ratings? If yes, what is the liner relationship?

5.Do higher-priced smartwatches receive larger absolute discounts compared to lower-priced ones or highly rated ones or both? 


### Data Analysis



### Results/Findings

1. Amazon offered more competitive discounts on smartwatches, with an average discount of 69.82% compared to 23.29% for smartphones. The median and mode discounts for smartwatches are 74.5% and 75.0%, much higher than the 25% and 28% seen in smartphones. This implies that consumers looking for the best deals are more likely to find deeper and more frequent discounts on smartwatches than on smartphones on Amazon. Retailers may be using aggressive pricing strategies for smartwatches to attract buyers and increase sales in this category.
   
2.Smartwatches also show greater variability (13.48 standard deviation) and more extreme discounts, reflected in a stronger negative skewness (-1.02 vs. -0.74).

3. Smartwatches discounts exhibit more variability than smartphones discounts, as shown by a higher standard deviation of 13.48 compared to 8.71 for smartphones.
